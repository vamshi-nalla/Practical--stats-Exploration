    "\n",
    "Statisticians often use the term **\"estimate\"** to describe a value calculated from data, emphasizing that it is an approximation — not the exact truth. This reflects the core principle of statistics: dealing with **uncertainty** and understanding how far our calculations might be from the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, data scientists and business analysts typically refer to the same kind of value as a **\"metric\"**. Their focus is less on uncertainty and more on **tracking performance** or **achieving specific business objectives**. A metric is treated as a concrete number used for decision-making and evaluating progress.\n",

    "## **Trimmed Mean**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **trimmed mean** is a variation of the average (mean) that helps reduce the effect of extreme values (very high or very low numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a trimmed mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort** the data values from smallest to largest.\n",
    "2. **Remove** a fixed number of the smallest and largest values (this number is usually the same at both ends).\n",
    "3. **Calculate** the average (mean) of the values that are left.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-Life Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **international diving competitions**, each diver is scored by 5 judges. To prevent bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **highest** and **lowest** scores are removed.\n",
    "* The remaining **three scores** are averaged to get the final score.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it harder for a single judge to unfairly influence the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use It**\n",
    "\n",
    "Trimmed means are useful when your data may include **outliers** or **errors** that could skew a normal average. In many situations, a trimmed mean gives a **more accurate and fair** summary of the data than the regular mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we’re collecting data from several sensors, and one of them is **less accurate**.\n",
    "We can **give it a lower weight** so that its less reliable data doesn't affect the final average too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  2. **The data doesn’t fairly represent all groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "In an **online experiment**, one group of users may have much more data than another.\n",
    "To **correct this imbalance**, we can **assign weights** to each group to better represent the entire population.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use a weighted mean when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some data points are **more accurate**, **more important**, or **more relevant**.\n",
    "* Your dataset is **imbalanced**, and you want to **correct for over- or under-represented groups**.\n",

    "The **median** is the value that lies **in the middle** of a **sorted list** of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of data points is **odd**, the **middle value** is the median.\n",
    "* If the number is **even**, the **median** is the **average of the two middle values**, even if that value isn't actually in the dataset.\n",

    "## **Median vs Mean (Average)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **mean** takes into account **all values** in the dataset.\n",
    "* The **median** only depends on the **middle position** in the sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the mean might seem more informative because it uses all data points, it’s also more **sensitive to outliers** (very large or very small values). In contrast, the **median is more stable** when outliers are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example: Household Incomes in Seattle**\n",
